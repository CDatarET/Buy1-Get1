# Buy1-Get1

Alice visited Byteland to purchase jewels for her upcoming wedding anniversary.

In Byteland, every jewelry shop has its own discount methods to attract customers. One discount method called **Buy1-Get1** caught Alice's attention. That is, if Alice buys one jewel, she can get one additional jewel of the same color for free.

Alice lists the needed jewels as a string `S`, where:
- Each character represents one jewel.
- Same characters denote jewels of the same color.
- Different characters denote jewels of different colors.
- The cost of each jewel is 1.

Your task is to calculate the **minimum cost** for getting all the jewels Alice listed, considering the Buy1-Get1 offer.

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- The next `T` lines each contain a string `S`, representing the jewels Alice needs.

## Output

- For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum cost to get all the jewels.

## Constraints

- `1 <= T <= 100`
- `1 <= |S| <= 1000`
- `S` contains only uppercase or lowercase English letters.
